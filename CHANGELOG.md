## [Unreleased]

### LiteRT 2.2.0 support

Vendored headers bumped v2.1.6 → v2.2.0 (`third_party/litert-v2.2.0/`) and
all six 64-bit binding files regenerated. `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` is
deliberately left on its 2.1.4-era bindings — its prebuilt tarball is a
CMake+emscripten build of v2.1.4.

- **BREAKING (Windows only) — `LiteRtLayout` is now 68 bytes on MSVC too.**
  Through 2.1.6 the struct was `unsigned int rank : 7` + `bool has_strides : 1`,
  and MSVC refuses to coalesce adjacent bitfields whose underlying types
  differ, so `dimensions` sat at offset 8 (size 72) on Windows against
  offset 4 (size 68) everywhere else. Upstream made `has_strides` an
  `unsigned int : 1` (google-ai-edge/LiteRT#7459) and dropped the `_MSC_VER`
  branch of the header's own `static_assert`s. **A Windows consumer must
  upgrade `libLiteRt.dll` to 2.2.0 in lockstep with this release** — pairing
  these bindings with a 2.1.6 DLL reads every tensor shape shifted by one
  `i32` (a `[10, 10]` input comes back as `[0, 10]`), with no compile error.
  Linux/Android/macOS layouts are unchanged.
- **BREAKING (source) — `LiteRtLayout::has_strides`/`set_has_strides` now
  take and return `c_uint` rather than `bool`,** following the bitfield's new
  underlying type. `litert`'s own call site is updated.
- **New regression test** `litert-sys/tests/layout_abi.rs` pins
  `LiteRtLayout` and `LiteRtRankedTensorType` sizes and field offsets to the
  upstream `static_assert`s. `build.rs` runs bindgen with
  `layout_tests(false)`, so nothing else in the crate catches a binding file
  that disagrees with the header it came from — which is how the offset bug
  above shipped the first time.
- **Additive C API surface**, picked up by the regen: new
  `LiteRtGetCompiledModelEnvironment`; new enum values
  `kLiteRtDelegatePrecisionFp16WithFp32Accum` (3),
  `kLiteRtEnvOptionTagContext` (28), `kLiteRtEnvOptionTagWebGpuFlushCallback`
  (29); `kLiteRtCpuKernelModeDelegate` added as the new spelling of
  `kLiteRtCpuKernelModeXnnpack` (both still 0). No function was removed and
  no existing signature changed — unlike the 2.1.4 → 2.1.6 bump, which
  shifted arguments across the compiled-model family.
- **Not bumped:** `LITERT_MAVEN_VERSION` is still `2.1.4`, so the default
  (no `LITERT_LIB_DIR`) Android path still downloads a 2.1.4 AAR. Consumers
  must point `LITERT_LIB_DIR` at real 2.2.0 libraries. Ditto `LITERT_LM_TAG`
  (`v0.10.2`) for the desktop prebuilts.

## [0.3.0] — WASM (browser + server) support for `litert-sys` / `litert`

First-class `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` target for the base TFLite inference
layer. Build a `.wasm` from Rust that runs in browsers (via the emscripten
JS shim), Node.js, or wasmtime. CPU-only via TFLite + XNNPACK; GPU + LLM
deferred.

- **`litert-sys`** — new `DistKind::WasmTarball` variant downloads a
  SHA-pinned tarball of static archives produced by the new
  `build-litert-wasm.yml` GitHub Actions workflow (CMake+emscripten build of
  LiteRT v2.1.4 + our `wasm-patches/`). build.rs globs `lib*.a` from the
  cache and emits `cargo:rustc-link-lib=static=…` for each — wasm-ld
  dead-strips unreferenced symbols.
- **`litert`** — `set_global_log_severity` returns `Error::Unsupported` on
  WASM (libloading dlopen isn't available; `libLiteRt.a` doesn't export the
  logger-control symbols anyway). `libloading` dependency is gated to
  non-WASM via `[target.'cfg(...)']` so users on WASM don't pay for it.
- **Patches** — two minimal CMake changes to upstream LiteRT v2.1.4
  (`wasm-patches/litert-v2.1.4/`): FetchContent OpenCL headers (so
  `open_cl_memory.cc` compiles even though OpenCL isn't called at runtime),
  and force `FLATBUFFERS_LOCALE_INDEPENDENT=0` globally to match the
  flatbuffers library's emcc build.
- **Example** — `litert/examples/add_wasm.rs` builds a 12 MB `.wasm` with
  emscripten JS glue. **Verified end-to-end** locally on macOS arm64 with
  emsdk 5.0.7: `node add_wasm.js` (with `-sNODERAWFS=1` link flag) loads
  the bundled `add_10x10.tflite`, runs inference, and prints the correct
  element-wise sums (`output[i] = 100 + 2i`).

`litertlm` and `litert-lm-sys` remain desktop-only this release. WASM for
those is deferred to 0.4.0 — the LiteRT-LM CMake orchestrator has a
prebuild-stage bug that inherits emcmake env when it shouldn't, plus the
transitive C++ dep chain (sentencepiece, tokenizers-cpp, antlr4) needs
patches we haven't authored yet. See `wasm-patches/litert-lm-v0.10.2/`.

## [0.2.1] — Multimodal vision + streaming fixes

- **Vision inference** via `Conversation::send_raw_stream` with image file
  paths in JSON. Tested with Gemma 4 E2B (2.4 GB) — correctly identifies
  objects and describes scenes from JPEG images.
- **`Input` enum** — `Text`, `Image`, `ImageEnd`, `Audio`, `AudioEnd` for
  `Session::generate_with_inputs`.
- **`Conversation::send_raw_stream`** now public for custom JSON messages
  (multimodal content arrays with image paths).
- Vision encoder runs on CPU by default to avoid absl ODR crash between
  `libLiteRtLmC` and `libLiteRtWebGpuAccelerator` (both statically link
  absl; text generation still uses GPU).
- Log suppression: `litert_lm_set_min_log_level(3)` + `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL`.

## [0.2.0] — LiteRT-LM crates

Adds `litert-lm-sys` and `litert-lm` for on-device LLM inference.
End-to-end verified: Qwen3-0.6B generates text on both CPU and GPU.

### New crates

- **`litert-lm-sys`** — 46 `litert_lm_*` FFI bindings from `c/engine.h`.
  `build.rs` downloads `libLiteRtLmC.{so,dylib}` (built from source via
  Bazel) from our mirrored GitHub release, SHA-256-verified.
- **`litertlm`** — safe API: `Engine`, `EngineSettings` with typed
  `Backend` enum, `Session::generate`, `Conversation::send_message_stream`
  for token-by-token streaming, `SamplerParams` (TopK/TopP/Greedy).

### Highlights

- **GPU inference** works via `CreateAny` factory (Metal/WebGPU).
- **CPU inference** works with TopP sampling and null vision/audio backends.
- **Conversation API** applies model prompt templates correctly for streaming.
- Auto-download of Qwen3-0.6B in the example.

### Known limitations

- WebGPU delegate `I0000` log lines go to stderr (hardcoded, can't suppress).
- CPU TopK sampler not implemented upstream; use TopP.
- Windows and Android not yet supported for `litert-lm-sys`.

## [0.1.0] — initial release

Initial public release covering `litert-sys` (raw FFI) and `litert` (safe
wrappers) for Google's LiteRT 2.x on-device ML runtime.

### Published crates

- **`litert-sys 0.1.0`** — raw `LiteRt*` C API bindings, pre-generated for
  every supported target. `build.rs` downloads pinned prebuilt shared
  libraries (desktop via Git LFS, Android via Google Maven AAR) and
  verifies them against in-crate SHA-256 checksums before linking.
- **`litert 0.1.0`** — safe Rust wrappers: `Environment`, `Model`,
  `CompilationOptions`, `CompiledModel`, `TensorBuffer` with RAII lock
  guards, `Signature` introspection, `LogSeverity` control via runtime
  `libloading` dlsym.

### Not published (deferred to 0.2.0)

- `litert-lm-sys`, `litert-lm` — LiteRT-LM's C API is a static library
  with heavy dependencies (abseil, protobuf, flatbuffers, nlohmann_json);
  shipping requires standing up a CMake build-and-mirror pipeline first.

### Supported targets

| Rust target                   | CPU | GPU accelerator(s)       |
|-------------------------------|-----|--------------------------|
| `aarch64-apple-darwin`        | ✅  | Metal, WebGPU            |
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`    | ✅  | WebGPU                   |
| `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`   | ✅  | WebGPU                   |
| `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`      | ✅  | WebGPU                   |
| `aarch64-linux-android`       | ✅  | OpenCL/GL                |
| `x86_64-linux-android`        | ✅  | OpenCL/GL                |

iOS (`aarch64-apple-ios`) is deferred — no prebuilt exists upstream and
source-building requires CocoaPods / XCFramework packaging we haven't
wired up yet.

### Pinned upstream versions

- LiteRT **v2.1.4** — C API headers vendored under `third_party/`.
- LiteRT-LM **v0.10.2** — source of the prebuilt `libLiteRt.*` shared
  libraries downloaded at build time.
- LiteRT Maven AAR **2.1.4** — Android `libLiteRt.so` + `libLiteRtClGlAccelerator.so`.
